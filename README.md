Accurate classification of roasted coffee beans into impaired and unimpaired categories is crucial for product consistency and consumer satisfaction. In this study, we employed a balanced dataset of 7,200 images, equally divided between the two categories, to explore the effectiveness of various feature extraction methods including Color Coherence Vector, Zernike Moment shape, and LBP texture feature paired with machine learning classifiers such as RandomForest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. We evaluated the impact of four distinct image preprocessing techniques: original, augmented, denoised, and combined augmented-denoised.  Our results demonstrate that the highest classification accuracy of **95.97%** was achieved using a combination of Color Coherence Vector and Zernike Moment features with an Extra Trees classifier configured with 300 estimators, no maximum depth, a minimum of 1 sample per leaf, a minimum of 2 samples per split, and a random state of 42, on the dataset that employed both augmented and denoised images, without k-fold cross-validation. When a 5-fold cross-validation was applied, the model achieved an accuracy of **95.88%**, indicating that the approach remains robust even under rigorous evaluation. These findings highlight the potential of integrating advanced feature extraction with robust data augmentation and denoising strategies for improving quality assessment in coffee beans and potentially other agricultural products.
